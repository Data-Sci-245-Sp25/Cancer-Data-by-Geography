Tukey’s HSD pairwise comparisons revealed that East Portland had significantly higher lung cancer mortality rates compared to the North & Northeast (11.58 rate difference, p = 0.005), Central East (11.69 rate difference, p = 0.0045), and Northwest & Southwest (18.95 rate difference, p = 0.0000012) areas. Additionally, Northwest & Southwest Portland had significantly lower rates than the areas of East Portland (18.95 rate difference, p = 0.0000012), Southeast Portland (12.73 rate difference, p = 0.0015), and Gresham & Troutdale cities (11.65 rate difference, p = 0.0047).\n\n\nLimitations\nThere are significant limitations to our findings. Our analysis did not adjust for demographic factors that impact cancer mortality, such as race, gender, age, occupation, or smoker status. This is especially relevant for breast cancer mortality rates which were not restricted to the female population as is the convention in public health. Additionally, our dataset only includes ten years of data, making it limited for drawing conclusions regarding the impact of environmental factors currently impacting Multnomah County residents, many of which can take decades of data to draw strong conclusions about their impact. Regarding the quality of our dataset, approximately 20% of observations were dropped due to missing or incorrect FIPS codes leading to underestimates of true mortality rates.",

    "text": "Abstract\nPrevention of cancer mortality is a major public health concern as cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. The present study examines the relationship between geographic location and cancer mortality in Multnomah county across the top 3 types of cancer death between 2013 and 2022 using data obtained from the Multnomah County Health Department to answer the research question “How do the top 3 types of cancer death vary by geographic area (public use microdata area) over the past 10 years?”. We calculated cancer mortality rates per 100,000 individuals in the population and created maps to visualize these rates and changes over time. Through one way ANOVA tests and Tukey’s HSD pairwise comparisons conducted in R, we found significantly higher lung cancer mortality in East Portland and significantly lower lung cancer mortality in Northwest and Southwest Portland compared to other studied geographies. This analysis could inform further socioeconomic and demographic research into Multnomah county cancer mortality.",

    "text": "This research conducted all data analysis in R.\nThis research sourced all it’s data from a mortality dataset constructed by the Multnomah county health department\nA series of animated maps were made to visually represent cancer mortality rates across Public Use Microdata Area geographies.\nOne-way Anova and Tukey’s HSD tests were used to determine statistical significance of results.\n\nFor data analysis of cancer data by geographic region, all data processing was done in the R coding language with the end goal of producing data tables and other visualizations, including maps and graphs, that accurately report the rates of cancer death across geographies in Multnomah County over ten years. Given the highly sensitive nature of these data, only the aggregate data is available to the public, making many code samples on this page non-functional.\n\n\nThis project utilizes cancer mortality data gathered in Multnomah county between 2013 and 2022. This data was gathered at the individual level, meaning the information in each row of data corresponds to the same individual. This data set contains variables that correspond to date of death, zip code of residence, fips code of residence, age at time of death, sex, marital status, level of education, veteran status, ethnicity and race, occupation, industry of occupation, cause of death, if the death was tobacco related, and comorbidities at time of death. Our project concerns itself with the following variables:\n\ndresstatefips, drescountyfips, drescityfips, ddrestractm and ddrestractsuf: variables relating to the location of death, coded in FIPS code. These variables are critical for determining where cancer moralities are occurring. FIPS codes, or Federal Information Processing Standards codes, are used by the United States Federal Government to ensure consistent data collection across agencies. The smallest units included in these data, FIPS tracts, are drawn so each tract includes a population of approximately 2,500 to 8,000 people and favor boundary lines drawn on physical features such as roads or rivers, but may be drawn on legal boundaries when no physical boundary is available. FIPS tracts were later converted to PUMA, or Public Use Microdata Area codes, which are used within a state to identify geographies with populations of at least 100,000 people and are based on census tracts. PUMA codes were favored over FIPS codes or comparable systems, like ZIP codes, for thier compatibility with data collected in the American Community Survey and data work conducted by the Multnomah County Health Department.\ndmcaACME: reports primary cause of death. This variable was used to isolate the top three most common kinds of cancer death. These results were reported as ICD-10 codes, a system used to code health problems across a standardized set of categories. For our analysis, we were only concerned with data relating to the top 3 cancer types\nddodyear: reports year of death. This variable was used to group observations by year and obtain aggregate data for analysis.\n\nOur other major data source was the ACS, or American Community Survey, database. The American Community Survey is an annual survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau to obtain year to year demographic changes in the United States population. These data are not as comprehensive as the full United States Decennial Census, which attempts to gain a complete demography of the country, but are collected more frequently, as the Decennial Census is only completed every ten years while the American Community Survey is conducted annually. Thus, while ACS population data take the form of estimates rather than actual numbers, they are the preferred data source for this project. Our project concerns itself with the following variable:\n\nB01003_001: reports total population estimate by PUMA region. This is later used to calculate rate of mortality by geography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo transform the raw data into clean aggregate data, manipulation of the data set was completed in R. Numerous packages from the CRAN were downloaded to assist with analysis\nThe steps taken to clean these data are as follows:\n\nLoaded the data into our coding environment\nConcatenated composite FIPS code variables into one FIPS code\nIdentify the top 3 kinds of cancer death and limit the data to these types\nConverted FIPS codes to PUMA codes\nCreate an aggregated data set of the number of each type of cancer death by year and PUMA code.\n\nThe following code chunk includes the code used to create our aggregated data set used for statistical analysis. This code will produce no results, as the data used in it’s non-aggregated form is too sensitive for public use.\n\n\nCode\n#Step 1: load raw data\n#rawData &lt;- read_csv() #empty as original .csv file is not publically available\n\n\n#Step 2: concactenate fips\n#create padtract with 4 digits\n#withfips &lt;- rawData|&gt; mutate(padtract= str_pad(ddrestract, width = 4, pad = \"0\"))\n\n# create padtractsuf with 2 digits\n#withfips &lt;- withfips|&gt; mutate(padtractsuf = str_pad(ddrestractsuf, width = 2, pad = \"0\"))\n\n#concactenate into fipscode\n#withfips &lt;- withfips|&gt; mutate(fipscode = paste(\"41051\", padtract, padtractsuf, sep = \"\"))\n\n#remove padded columns\n#withfips &lt;- withfips|&gt; select(-padtract, -padtractsuf)\n\n\n#Step 3: identify and filter data to only include the top 3 types of cancer death\n#filter to only c and d icd10 codes\n#icdCodes&lt;-read_csv(\"../multCoData/icd10-codes.csv\")\n\n#cancerOnlyData &lt;- withfips |&gt; filter(startsWith(dmcaACME, \"C\") | startsWith(dmcaACME, \"D\"))\n\n#cancerOnlyData &lt;-cancerOnlyData |&gt; mutate(diseaseSite=icdCodes$Category[match(dmcaACME, icdCodes$`ICD-10 Code`)])\n\n#cancer10y &lt;- cancerOnlyData|&gt; filter(ddodyear &gt;= 2013)\n\n#Step 4: Convert to PUMA codes\n#puma &lt;- read_csv(\"~/multCoData/2020_Census_Tract_to_2020_PUMA.csv\")\n\n#puma &lt;- puma|&gt; filter(STATEFP == 41)\n\n#puma &lt;- puma|&gt; mutate(across(everything(), as.double))\n\n#tidydata &lt;- cancerOnlyData |&gt; left_join(puma, by = c(\"drescountyfips\" = \"COUNTYFP\", \"ddrestract\" = \"TRACTCE\"))\n\n#Step 5: Create an aggregated dataset where independent observations are number of cancer deaths.\n#aggregatedData &lt;-cancerOnlyData %&gt;% group_by(ddodyear,diseaseSite,pumaCode) %&gt;% summarise(totals=n())\n\n#prefixAg &lt;- aggregatedData %&gt;% mutate(PUMA = paste(\"41\", pumaCode, sep = \"\"))\n\n#mutateAg &lt;- prefixAg |&gt; mutate(pumasuffix = sub('^41051', '', PUMA))\n#mutateAg &lt;- mutateAg |&gt; mutate(newPUMA = paste(\"41013\", pumasuffix, sep = \"\"))\n\n\nThis code produces the data set aggregatedData, in which each observation is the number of cancer deaths of a specific type in a specific PUMA region for a specific year between 2013 and 2023. With our data in this form, we can next calculate the rate of mortality by region.\n\n\n\nNow that this aggregated data has been assembled with the number of cancer deaths in each region, proportions can be obtained with ACS Data.\nThe steps taken to form these data are as follows:\n\nLoad our new data set into Posit Cloud\nGather total population estimates for each PUMA code across all years\nJoin the two data sets and derive population proportions by dividing the number of cancer deaths for each cancer type by the total population estimate for that PUMA tract\n\nFor this stage of data processing, all analysis was done by year, repeating each code chunk for every year. For the sake of legibility, sample code is only provided for 2013. Wherever the number 2013 is present, it was changed to reflect the accurate year of the data being manipulated\n\n\nCode\n# Step 1: Load the data\n#prefixAg &lt;- read_csv(\"prefixAg.csv\", col_types = cols(ddodyear = col_character(),PUMA = col_character()))\n#mutateAg &lt;- read_csv(\"mutateAg.csv\", col_types = cols(ddodyear = col_character(), PUMA = col_character(), newPUMA = col_character()))\n\n\n#Step 2: Gather acs data for each year using tidycensus\n#popData2013 &lt;- get_acs(\n    #geography = \"public use microdata area\",\n    #variables = c(total_population = \"B01003_001\"),\n    #state = \"OR\",\n    #year = 2013,\n    #survey = \"acs5\",\n    #geometry = TRUE, output = \"wide\") \n\n#Step 3: Join datasets and derive population porportions\n#Ag13 &lt;- mutateAg|&gt; filter(ddodyear == 2013)\n\n#CancerRates2013 &lt;- popData2013 |&gt; right_join(Ag13, by = c(\"GEOID\" = \"newPUMA\")) |&gt; mutate(rate_per_100k = (totals / total_populationE) * 100000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last step in our project was to represent our data visually.\n\n\nOur primary visualization was a series of maps, grouped by cancer type. These maps visually represent the changing proportions over time.\nThe steps taken to generate these maps are as follows:\n\nGenerate dataframes that consist exclusively of the information needed to create a map\nGenerate maps based on these dataframes\n\nSample code for 2013 map generation is shown below\n\n\nCode\n#Step 1: Generates dataframes for map creation\n#CancerRatesLung2013 &lt;- CancerRates2013 %&gt;% filter(diseaseSite == \"Lung\")\n#CancerRatesBreast2013 &lt;- CancerRates2013 %&gt;% filter(diseaseSite == \"Breast\")\n#CancerRatesPancreas2013 &lt;- CancerRates2013 %&gt;% filter(diseaseSite == \"Pancreas\")\n\n# Step 2: Generate maps based on these dataframes\n#ggplot(CancerRatesLung2013) + geom_sf(mapping=aes(fill = rate_per_100k)) + scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Lung Cancer Deaths/100k residents\",limits = c(0, 50)) + theme_void() + labs(title=\"Estimated lung cancer deaths per 100k residents, 2013\")\n\n#ggplot(CancerRatesBreast2013) + geom_sf(mapping=aes(fill = rate_per_100k)) +scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Breast Cancer Deaths/100k residents\",limits = c(0, 25)) + theme_void() + labs(title=\"Estimated breast cancer deaths per 100k residents, 2013\")\n\n#ggplot(CancerRatesPancreas2013) + geom_sf(mapping=aes(fill = rate_per_100k)) + scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Pancreas Cancer Deaths/100k residents\",limits = c(0, 20)) + theme_void() + labs(title=\"Estimated pancreas cancer deaths per 100k residents, 2013\")\n\n\n\n\n\nOur final visualization combined the maps for all ten years into one gif for easier viewing.\nThe steps taken to generate these maps are as follows:\n\nCombine dataframes that include mortality rates for each year.\nGenerate maps based on this dataframe with the gganimate package\n\n\n\nCode\n#Step 1: Combined Dataframe\n#CancerRates &lt;- bind_rows(CancerRates2013, CancerRates2014, CancerRates2015, CancerRates2016, CancerRates2017, CancerRates2018, CancerRates2019, CancerRates2020, CancerRates2021, CancerRates2022)\n#CancerRatesLung &lt;- CancerRates %&gt;% filter(diseaseSite == \"Lung\")\n\n#Step 2: Generate Map\n#ggplot(CancerRatesLung) + geom_sf(mapping=aes(fill = rate_per_100k)) + scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Lung Cancer Deaths/100k residents\",limits = c(0, 50) + theme_void() + labs(title= \"Lung Cancer Deaths/100k residents, 2013 - 2022: {current_frame}\") + transition_manual(ddodyear) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between the geographic areas’ average mortality rates for each type of cancer was compared with a one way ANOVA. If significant differences were indicated at an alpha level of 0.05, post-hoc pairwise comparisons were done using Tukey’s Honest Significant Differences test.\n\n\nCode\n#oneWayAnovaLung &lt;- aov(CancerRatesLung$rate_per_100k ~ CancerRatesLung$pumaCode)\n#summary(oneWayAnovaLung)\n#TukeyHSD(oneWayAnovaLung, conf.level = .95)",

This code will produce no results, as the data used in it’s non-aggregated form is too sensitive for public use.\n\n\nCode\n#Step 1: load raw data\n#rawData &lt;- read_csv() #empty as original .csv file is not publically available\n\n\n#Step 2: concactenate fips\n#create padtract with 4 digits\n#withfips &lt;- rawData|&gt; mutate(padtract= str_pad(ddrestract, width = 4, pad = \"0\"))\n\n# create padtractsuf with 2 digits\n#withfips &lt;- withfips|&gt; mutate(padtractsuf = str_pad(ddrestractsuf, width = 2, pad = \"0\"))\n\n#concactenate into fipscode\n#withfips &lt;- withfips|&gt; mutate(fipscode = paste(\"41051\", padtract, padtractsuf, sep = \"\"))\n\n#remove padded columns\n#withfips &lt;- withfips|&gt; select(-padtract, -padtractsuf)\n\n\n#Step 3: identify and filter data to only include the top 3 types of cancer death\n#filter to only c and d icd10 codes\n#icdCodes&lt;-read_csv(\"../multCoData/icd10-codes.csv\")\n\n#cancerOnlyData &lt;- withfips |&gt; filter(startsWith(dmcaACME, \"C\") | startsWith(dmcaACME, \"D\"))\n\n#cancerOnlyData &lt;-cancerOnlyData |&gt; mutate(diseaseSite=icdCodes$Category[match(dmcaACME, icdCodes$`ICD-10 Code`)])\n\n#cancer10y &lt;- cancerOnlyData|&gt; filter(ddodyear &gt;= 2013)\n\n#Step 4: Convert to PUMA codes\n#puma &lt;- read_csv(\"~/multCoData/2020_Census_Tract_to_2020_PUMA.csv\")\n\n#puma &lt;- puma|&gt; filter(STATEFP == 41)\n\n#puma &lt;- puma|&gt; mutate(across(everything(), as.double))\n\n#tidydata &lt;- cancerOnlyData |&gt; left_join(puma, by = c(\"drescountyfips\" = \"COUNTYFP\", \"ddrestract\" = \"TRACTCE\"))\n\n#Step 5: Create an aggregated dataset where independent observations are number of cancer deaths.\n#aggregatedData &lt;-cancerOnlyData %&gt;% group_by(ddodyear,diseaseSite,pumaCode) %&gt;% summarise(totals=n())\n\n#prefixAg &lt;- aggregatedData %&gt;% mutate(PUMA = paste(\"41\", pumaCode, sep = \"\"))\n\n#mutateAg &lt;- prefixAg |&gt; mutate(pumasuffix = sub('^41051', '', PUMA))\n#mutateAg &lt;- mutateAg |&gt; mutate(newPUMA = paste(\"41013\", pumasuffix, sep = \"\"))\n\n\nThis code produces the data set aggregatedData, in which each observation is the number of cancer deaths of a specific type in a specific PUMA region for a specific year between 2013 and 2023. With our data in this form, we can next calculate the rate of mortality by region.\n\n\n\nNow that this aggregated data has been assembled with the number of cancer deaths in each region, proportions can be obtained with ACS Data.\nThe steps taken to form these data are as follows:\n\nLoad our new data set into Posit Cloud\nGather total population estimates for each PUMA code across all years\nJoin the two data sets and derive population proportions by dividing the number of cancer deaths for each cancer type by the total population estimate for that PUMA tract\n\nFor this stage of data processing, all analysis was done by year, repeating each code chunk for every year. For the sake of legibility, sample code is only provided for 2013. Wherever the number 2013 is present, it was changed to reflect the accurate year of the data being manipulated\n\n\nCode\n# Step 1: Load the data\n#prefixAg &lt;- read_csv(\"prefixAg.csv\", col_types = cols(ddodyear = col_character(),PUMA = col_character()))\n#mutateAg &lt;- read_csv(\"mutateAg.csv\", col_types = cols(ddodyear = col_character(), PUMA = col_character(), newPUMA = col_character()))\n\n\n#Step 2: Gather acs data for each year using tidycensus\n#popData2013 &lt;- get_acs(\n    #geography = \"public use microdata area\",\n    #variables = c(total_population = \"B01003_001\"),\n    #state = \"OR\",\n    #year = 2013,\n    #survey = \"acs5\",\n    #geometry = TRUE, output = \"wide\") \n\n#Step 3: Join datasets and derive population porportions\n#Ag13 &lt;- mutateAg|&gt; filter(ddodyear == 2013)\n\n#CancerRates2013 &lt;- popData2013 |&gt; right_join(Ag13, by = c(\"GEOID\" = \"newPUMA\")) |&gt; mutate(rate_per_100k = (totals / total_populationE) * 100000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last step in our project was to represent our data visually.\n\n\nOur primary visualization was a series of maps, grouped by cancer type. These maps visually represent the changing proportions over time.\nThe steps taken to generate these maps are as follows:\n\nGenerate dataframes that consist exclusively of the information needed to create a map\nGenerate maps based on these dataframes\n\nSample code for 2013 map generation is shown below\n\n\nCode\n#Step 1: Generates dataframes for map creation\n#CancerRatesLung2013 &lt;- CancerRates2013 %&gt;% filter(diseaseSite == \"Lung\")\n#CancerRatesBreast2013 &lt;- CancerRates2013 %&gt;% filter(diseaseSite == \"Breast\")\n#CancerRatesPancreas2013 &lt;- CancerRates2013 %&gt;% filter(diseaseSite == \"Pancreas\")\n\n# Step 2: Generate maps based on these dataframes\n#ggplot(CancerRatesLung2013) + geom_sf(mapping=aes(fill = rate_per_100k)) + scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Lung Cancer Deaths/100k residents\",limits = c(0, 50)) + theme_void() + labs(title=\"Estimated lung cancer deaths per 100k residents, 2013\")\n\n#ggplot(CancerRatesBreast2013) + geom_sf(mapping=aes(fill = rate_per_100k)) +scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Breast Cancer Deaths/100k residents\",limits = c(0, 25)) + theme_void() + labs(title=\"Estimated breast cancer deaths per 100k residents, 2013\")\n\n#ggplot(CancerRatesPancreas2013) + geom_sf(mapping=aes(fill = rate_per_100k)) + scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Pancreas Cancer Deaths/100k residents\",limits = c(0, 20)) + theme_void() + labs(title=\"Estimated pancreas cancer deaths per 100k residents, 2013\")\n\n\n\n\n\nOur final visualization combined the maps for all ten years into one gif for easier viewing.\nThe steps taken to generate these maps are as follows:\n\nCombine dataframes that include mortality rates for each year.\nGenerate maps based on this dataframe with the gganimate package\n\n\n\nCode\n#Step 1: Combined Dataframe\n#CancerRates &lt;- bind_rows(CancerRates2013, CancerRates2014, CancerRates2015, CancerRates2016, CancerRates2017, CancerRates2018, CancerRates2019, CancerRates2020, CancerRates2021, CancerRates2022)\n#CancerRatesLung &lt;- CancerRates %&gt;% filter(diseaseSite == \"Lung\")\n\n#Step 2: Generate Map\n#ggplot(CancerRatesLung) + geom_sf(mapping=aes(fill = rate_per_100k)) + scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Lung Cancer Deaths/100k residents\",limits = c(0, 50) + theme_void() + labs(title= \"Lung Cancer Deaths/100k residents, 2013 - 2022: {current_frame}\") + transition_manual(ddodyear) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between the geographic areas’ average mortality rates for each type of cancer was compared with a one way ANOVA. If significant differences were indicated at an alpha level of 0.05, post-hoc pairwise comparisons were done using Tukey’s Honest Significant Differences test.\n\n\nCode\n#oneWayAnovaLung &lt;- aov(CancerRatesLung$rate_per_100k ~ CancerRatesLung$pumaCode)\n#summary(oneWayAnovaLung)\n#TukeyHSD(oneWayAnovaLung, conf.level = .95)",
